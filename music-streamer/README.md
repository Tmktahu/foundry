# Foundry VTT Music Streamer

This is a simple module that adds a small HTML audio player meant specifically for playing an audio stream.

I coded this for my own personal use so I could steam live music to my sessions, letting me rely on my own local audio player as needed.

The module has a play button, a stop button, a volume slider, and a settings button that reveals a text field where you can change the URL of the audio stream.

If the GM of the game updates the stream URL, then it is also updated for all users.
